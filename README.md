# Fitness-Mobil-App

Please check the issues to see the screenshots of fitness application for better understanding and enjoy the free resources.

Android Project: I have created a fitness application using java language in Android Studio operating system.
Action Steps: Designing UI of the project, getting and storing information of users in the database.
Result: users, before browsing the app, should sign up on the application or if they are already registered, they can log in to it. Then, they can see the poplar exercises which came from API and can save them or share them with someone else. Users have their profile for its required information also, can follow other users to set something together. There is another page to get the diet food receptions with the restaurant's location for users who are interested in it.
